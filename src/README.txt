
Notes on java codes:

-NetworkSimulator is an abstract class that is the bulk of the simulator. 

-StudentNetworkSimulator is the only class that you will have to modify.

-Packet, Message, Event, and EventListImpl are support classes. 

-EventList is an interface.  

-Project is the "driver" for the whole thing. 

-You only need the  .class  files, and StudentNetworkSimulator.java.  

-The other sources are there in case you are interested. 

-StudentNetworkSimulator.java contains inline comments documenting the interfaces of the other classes that you will need.  

-These class files will need to be in the CLASSPATH (which will happen automatically if you edit and compile StudentNetworkSimulator.java in the same directory as the other class files).
