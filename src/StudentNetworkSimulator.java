     * Predefined Constants (static member variables):
     *
     *   int MAXDATASIZE : the maximum size of the Message data and
     *                     Packet payload
     *
     *   int A           : a predefined integer that represents entity A
     *   int B           : a predefined integer that represents entity B
     *
     *
     * Predefined Member Methods:
     *
     *  void stopTimer(int entity): 
     *       Stops the timer running at "entity" [A or B]
     *  void startTimer(int entity, double increment): 
     *       Starts a timer running at "entity" [A or B], which will expire in
     *       "increment" time units, causing the interrupt handler to be
     *       called.  You should only call this with A.
     *  void toLayer3(int callingEntity, Packet p)
     *       Puts the packet "p" into the network from "callingEntity" [A or B]
     *  void toLayer5(int entity, String dataSent)
     *       Passes "dataSent" up to layer 5 from "entity" [A or B]
     *  double getTime()
     *       Returns the current time in the simulator.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging.
     *  void printEventList()
     *       Prints the current event list to stdout.  Might be useful for
     *       debugging, but probably not.

     *      Packet (int seq, int ack, int check, String newPayload)
